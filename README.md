# Studends-Exam-Score-Analysis

The objective of the project appears to be analyzing students' scores to understand various factors that may influence academic performance. This includes examining the relationships between scores and variables such as gender, parents' education levels, parents' marital status, and ethnic groups.

Tools and Technologies Used:-

Python Libraries:

NumPy: Used for numerical operations.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Seaborn: Used for making statistical graphics.


Project Analysis Steps

Data Loading and Inspection:

Reading the dataset (student_scores.csv) into a DataFrame.
Inspecting the first few rows and the summary statistics of the DataFrame.
Checking for missing values.
Data Cleaning:

Dropping unnecessary columns.

Visualizations:

Gender Distribution: Using count plot to visualize the distribution of gender.

Parent's Education Impact: Using groupby and heatmap to visualize the relationship between parents' education and students' scores.

Parent's Marital Status Impact: Using groupby and heatmap to visualize the relationship between parents' marital status and students' scores.

Boxplots: Creating boxplots to visualize the distribution of math, reading, and writing scores.

Ethnic Group Distribution: Using pie charts and count plots to visualize the distribution of students across different ethnic groups.
Key Findings

Gender distribution indicates more females than males in the data.

Parent's education has a positive impact on students' scores.

Parent's marital status has negligible impact on students' scores.

Boxplots provide insights into the distribution of scores in different subjects.

Ethnic group distribution is analyzed using pie charts and count plots.
